Welcome to website develop's documentation!
===========================================


This is a tutorial introduction to quickly get you up and running with
your own sphinx documentation system.  We'll cover installing sphinx,
customizing the look and feel, using custom extensions for embedding
plots, inheritance diagrams, syntax highlighted ipython sessions and
more.  If you follow along the tutorial, you'll start with nothing and
end up with this site -- it's the bootstrapping documentation tutorial
that writes itself!

The source code for this tutorial lives in mpl git (see
:ref:`fetching-the-data`) and you can grab a hardcopy of the
`sampledoc PDF <sampledoc.pdf>`_
